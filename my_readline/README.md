# Welcome to My Readline
***

## Task
The function my_readline reads a line from the strean represented by fd and returns it into an allocated string (heap or stack ?). It stops when either the newline character is read or when the end-of-file is reached, whichever comes first. The newline character is not copied to the string.
On success, a pointer to the string is returned. On error, a null pointer is returned. If the end-of-file occurs before any characters have been read, the string remains unchanged.
Your code must be compiled with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
